# About me
Currently learning: Java, HTML, CSS <br>
I'm a second year bachelor of engineering student who has loved computers and hardware since forever. I also enjoy editing videos, playing the guitar, and making pixel art.

# Projects
A list of projects I'm most proud of.

### Colour Theory
https://github.com/DefinitelyNotWence/Colour-Theory <br>
A little 2D pixel art platformer where you play as a slime that changes colours to adapt to the varying conditions of each level. <br>

More to come :)
